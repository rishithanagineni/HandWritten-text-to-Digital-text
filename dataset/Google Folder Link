For the submission of Final Project Report, I uploaded the csv files used for the training and evaluation of the model.
Additionally I included the tgz file of all of the word images within the IAM dataset. This file was divided into 33 files 
for uploading. For the project we used a copy of the IAM database stored on google drive account. 

Here is a shared link to view the complete dataset we used for the project.
