# HandWritten-text-to-Digital-text
This project was an exploration and implementation of TrOCR
The project set out to create a web app that can identify handwritten words and return a ditigal text verison.

There are 3 directories, Model training, dataset, and web application.
Model training contains all jupyter notebooks used to preprocess and train the TrOCR models
dataset contains the csv files resulting from the preprocess, link to the google folder with the IAM dataset, and the word tgz files
Web application contains all of the files for the web application excluding the model. 

The trained model will be submitted with the report due to issues with uploading them to github
Additionally a google folder share link will be provided as well.
